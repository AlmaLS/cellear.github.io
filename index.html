Greetings!  I am a seasoned web team manager and technology consultant
with 18 years of experience directly managing engineers, graphic artists,
and content creators. I am relentlessly customer-focused and passionate
about delivering the best possible user experience.  Websites are not
just a job for me -- I care deeply about helping my users get the most
out of whatever theyâ€™re trying to do.
